## 1. VERSION INFORMATION

No library -- scraper-based wrapper using direct form POST to MOPS.

---

## 2. DOCUMENTATION SOURCES

### Primary Source -- MOPS (Government Website, No Official API)
- **URL**: https://mops.twse.com.tw
- **Verified**: 2026-02-24 (via repo doc `MOP Api doc`)
- **No API key required** -- form POST scraping

### Secondary Source -- TWSE (Government API for company list)
- **URL**: https://www.twse.com.tw
- **Endpoint**: /exchangeReport/STOCK_DAY_ALL?response=json

---

## 3. WRAPPER CODE AUDIT

### Mode 1: No unofficial wrapper -- scraper-based

### Mode 2: Direct form POST (Government Website Scraping)

| Method | Status | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `list_companies()` | OK | TWSE `/exchangeReport/STOCK_DAY_ALL` correct |
| `get_profile()` | OK | Constructs from search results |
| `_fetch_mops_financials()` | VERIFY | Form POST endpoints need verification |
| ROC date conversion | OK | `_roc_to_ce()` and `_ce_to_roc()` correct (ROC 115 = CE 2026) |

### Form POST Endpoints (Need Runtime Verification)
```
POST https://mops.twse.com.tw/mops/web/ajax_{step}
- t163sb04: Income statement
- t163sb05: Balance sheet
- t163sb20: Cash flow
```
These step codes are from the MOPS website's form action. They may change
if MOPS redesigns their web interface.

### Canonical Field Coverage (via _TIFRS_MAP)
- Chinese field names mapped: revenue, cost_of_revenue, gross_profit, operating_income,
  net_income, ebit, taxes, interest_expense, total_assets, total_liabilities, etc.
- Coverage looks comprehensive for Taiwan IFRS (TIFRS)

---

## 4. REQUIRED FIXES

1. **NONE critical** -- form POST pattern and field mapping look correct
2. **MINOR**: MOPS form endpoints (t163sb04/05/20) should be verified at runtime
3. **MINOR**: Response parsing depends on HTML table structure that could change

---

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### Recommendation
- READY TO IMPLEMENT -- scraping pattern correct, TIFRS mapping comprehensive
