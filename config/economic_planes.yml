# Economic planes mapping (5-plane Sudoku world model).
#
# Maps GICS-style sectors and industries to the 5 economic planes
# described in The_Apps_core_idea.pdf Section A.
#
# A company can participate in multiple planes. The primary plane
# is determined by sector; secondary planes come from industry matches.
# This classification informs linked variable routing, not the
# survival hierarchy (which is tier-based, not plane-based).
