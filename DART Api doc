The **Guide for Developers to Original Disclosure Document File** from the **Open DART** (English version of Korea's DART system, operated by the Financial Supervisory Service – FSS) describes the API endpoint for downloading the **original full disclosure document** (e.g., complete filing/report in ZIP/XML format) submitted by Korean companies.

This is a binary file download endpoint — not structured JSON/XML data like other DART APIs. It's ideal for your repo's `dart.py` client when you need the raw, complete filing (e.g., full annual report, major event report) rather than pre-extracted fields.

### Basic Information
- **Method**: GET
- **Requested URL**: `https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/engapi/document.xml`
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Output Format**: ZIP file (binary) containing XML (and possibly other attachments like PDF/XBRL)
  - **Important browser note**: In Chrome/Edge, the downloaded file may save as `.xml` instead of `.zip` due to browser handling of content-type. Rename the extension to `.zip` and extract normally to access contents.
  - Browser testing not fully supported for binary ZIP output — best tested via code (e.g., Python `requests`).

### Required Parameters (Query String)
All passed as query parameters:

| Parameter    | Name                  | Type       | Required | Description                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| crtfc_key   | API authentication key | STRING(40) | Yes      | Issued 40-digit authentication key (from registration) |
| rcept_no    | Filing No.            | STRING(14) | Yes      | Receipt/filing number (e.g., 20190401004781)     |

**Example URL**:
```
https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/engapi/document.xml?crtfc_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&rcept_no=20190401004781
```

### Response
- Success: Binary ZIP file download (HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/zip or similar).
- Error: XML or text with error info (status/message fields).

**Error Codes & Messages** (in response):
- **000**: Normal (success)
- **010**: Not a registered key
- **011**: Key suspended/temporarily unusable
- **012**: IP not allowed
- **013**: No data/viewable
- **014**: File does not exist
- **020**: Call limit exceeded (often ~20,000/day; may vary)
- **021**: Exceeded company view limit (up to 100 at once)
- **100**: Invalid field value
- **101**: Inappropriate access
- **800**: Service suspended for maintenance
- **900**: Undefined error
- **901**: Key unusable (personal info retention expired) — contact opendart@fss.or.kr

### How to Get Started (Authentication Key)
1. **Register** at the English portal: https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/ (or https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/uss/umt/EgovMberInsertView.do for key application).
   - Provide: email, password, application type (individual/corporate), usage purpose, IP (if corporate), etc.
   - Consent to terms & personal info collection.
   - Key issued after approval (40 characters, stored in `.env` as `DART_API_KEY` or similar).
2. **Terms & Conditions** (effective Jan 21, 2020, still current):
   - Free service.
   - Limits: Posted on site; may change with notice.
   - No multiple keys per user.
   - Suspension for abuse, hacking attempts, excessive access.
   - FSS disclaims accuracy/completeness of data (responsibility of submitter).
   - Personal info retained until withdrawal (consent re-sought every 2 years).
3. **Rate Limits**: Not strictly fixed in docs (~20,000/day typical, but configurable); implement backoff/retries.
4. **Usage Tips for Your Repo**:
   - Cache downloaded ZIPs in `cache/` (keyed by rcept_no).
   - Extract ZIP → parse XML (use `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml` in Python).
   - Cross-reference rcept_no from other DART APIs (e.g., corpCode.xml for company codes, or disclosure list APIs).
   - Handle binary response: `response.content` → save as `{rcept_no}.zip`.

### Related APIs (Context from Open DART)
The original document endpoint is part of a broader set. Other useful APIs (from https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/intro/infoApiList.do):
- **Financial statements** (major accounts, full XBRL, indicators) — structured data.
- **Major issues** (mergers, capital changes, lawsuits, etc.) — extracted fields.
- **Significant holdings**, **executives/major shareholders**, etc.

For full list/guides: https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/intro/infoApiList.do (API service list)  
Developer details/examples: Check per-API "Guide for Developers" links on site (e.g., https://engopendart.fss.or.kr/guide/detail.do?apiGrpCd=DE001&apiId=AE00003 for this document endpoint).

This endpoint is perfect for fetching complete raw filings to normalize in your pipeline (e.g., via `canonical_translator.py`). If implementing in `dart.py`, add:
- Load key from `.env`.
- GET request with params.
- Save/extract ZIP.
- Error parsing from response.text if not 200.
