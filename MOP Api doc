Here are the most relevant **unofficial / community wrappers, scrapers, and libraries** for accessing **TWSE MOPS** (Market Observation Post System) data programmatically. These are primarily open-source projects on GitHub that simulate form submissions (POST requests) to MOPS endpoints (e.g., monthly revenue, financial statements, material announcements) since there is no free public REST API.

These tools are free, Python-based (or adaptable to Python), and commonly used for equity research pipelines like yours (e.g., fetching filings for point-in-time alignment in `operator1/clients/mops.py`).

### Python-Focused Scrapers & Wrappers
1. **yutingshih/stockspider**  
   - GitHub: https://github.com/yutingshih/stockspider  
   - Description: A Python web crawler specifically for TWSE stock prices **and financial reports** from MOPS. Supports fetching financial statements, revenue, etc.  
   - Requirements: Python 3.6+, requests, pandas.  
   - Status: Actively maintained in past; clean code for integration.  
   - Best for: Full financial reports (balance sheets, income statements) — adapt endpoints for your needs.

2. **arrtvv852/TWSE-Data-News-Included-Crawling**  
   - GitHub: https://github.com/arrtvv852/TWSE-Data-News-Included-Crawling  
   - Description: Scrapes stock data from TWSE + news/material info from MOPS (e.g., via t05st01 endpoint). Includes Download.py for core data and NewsScrap.py for announcements.  
   - Useful: Material information / major events (similar to your repo's micro data needs).  
   - Run sequence: Download.py first, then process.

3. **bryanyang0528/TWSE_Crawler**  
   - GitHub: https://github.com/bryanyang0528/TWSE_Crawler  
   - Description: Crawler notebook (twse_crawler.ipynb) for Taiwan public info observation station (MOPS) data — includes financials and disclosures.  
   - Format: Jupyter notebook — easy to test/adapt in your pipeline.

4. **Medium Tutorial with Code** (Practical monthly revenue scraper)  
   - Article: https://dignoape.medium.com/how-to-extract-monthly-revenue-information-in-taiwan-stock-exchange-via-python-c72240b84ee9  
   - Description: Step-by-step Python code using requests + pandas to scrape monthly revenue from MOPS URLs like `https://mops.twse.com.tw/nas/t21/sii/t21sc03_{date}_0.html` (handles sii/otc, local/Cayman companies).  
   - Includes SQLite caching — directly useful for your `cache/` system.  
   - Code pattern: Loop over dates, POST form data, parse HTML tables.

### Other Notable / Adaptable Projects
- **yidas/twse-mops-api-php**  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/yidas/twse-mops-api-php  
  - Description: PHP-based "API" wrapper for MOPS (simulates requests).  
  - Use: Port logic to Python (endpoints match Python scrapers).

- **yhsiang/mops-tw**  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/yhsiang/mops-tw  
  - Description: Simple crawler from mops.twse.com.tw (older, but basic form submission examples).

- **ga642381/Taiwan-Stock-Crawler**  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/ga642381/Taiwan-Stock-Crawler  
  - Description: Focuses on TWSE trading data, but includes some MOPS-like crawling patterns.

### Recommendations for Your Repo (Abdu2424/Op-1)
- **Start with**: yutingshih/stockspider or the Medium monthly revenue code — both are Python-native and target financial reports/revenue (key for micro/company data in `mops.py`).
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Use `requests.Session()` for persistent cookies (MOPS forms often require it).
  - Set headers: User-Agent, Referer to mimic browser.
  - Handle encoding: response.encoding = 'big5' or 'utf-8'.
  - Parse tables: `pandas.read_html(response.text)` or BeautifulSoup.
  - Rate limit: Sleep 1-5 seconds between requests; cache aggressively.
  - Legal/Ethical: Public data, but avoid overload (respect robots.txt); for research/non-commercial use.
- **If blocked**: Rotate User-Agents, use proxies, or fallback to third-party (e.g., FinMind API free tier for Taiwan fundamentals: https://finmind.github.io/ — has MOPS-derived data).

No single "official unofficial Python package" (like pip-installable with full MOPS coverage) dominates, but the above GitHub repos provide ready code to copy/adapt. Search GitHub for "mops.twse python" for forks/updates.

MOP isn't free make a workaround plan using arctict mode
